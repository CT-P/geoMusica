 â€œWe have also sound-houses, where we practise and 
 demonstrate all sounds, and their generation. 
 We have harmonies which you have not, of 
 quarter-sounds, and lesser slides of sounds. 
 Divers instruments of music likewise to you 
 unknown, some sweeter than any you have, together 
 with bells and rings that are dainty and sweet. 
 We represent small sounds as great and deep; 
 likewise great sounds extenuate and sharp; 
 we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds,
 which in their original are entire. We represent 
 and imitate all articulate sounds and letters, 
 and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. 
 We have certain helps which set to the ear do 
 further the hearing greatly. We have also divers 
 strange and artificial echoes, reflecting the 
 voice many times, and as it were tossing it: 
 and some  that give back the voice louder than it 
 came, some shriller, and some deeper; yea, some 
 rendering the voice differing in the letters or 
 articulate sound from that they receive. 
 We have also means to convey sounds in trunks 
 and pipes, in strange lines and distances." 
 
 Sir Francis Bacon, in "The New Atlantis", 1626

ABOUT:

geoMusica is a tool to make music with geometry. 
Compose geometries and listen to the musical 
translation in realtime, perform and experiment 
with the Sacred Geometry inspired methods and be 
amazed by the beauty hidden within the Mathemagics. 

it is structured as a multi-layer composing tool, 
focused on geometrical parameters that can be set 
with special proportions and shapes, and should be 
used has a MIDI note generator, connected with your 
favorite electronic instruments to reproduce the 
musical output. Therefore, should be considered as 
a generative MIDI sequencer in terms of families of 
musical software, and its aimed at musicians that 
use electronic tools for creation. 

this project started as a personal research on 
Sacred Geometry studies, within the scope of the 
3 year introdutory course that I attended led by 
Prof. Luis Elye, to the amazing field of knowledge 
hidden inside the Traditional geometrical legacy. 
with roots lost in time, this knowledge proved 
fundamental in bringing ordered geometrical shapes 
that generate meaningful musical correspondance, 
and revealing a hidden structural connection between 
geometry and music that becames obvious when 
exploring this tool.

as the research evolved, i've managed to do some 
outputs in form of talks and live concerts, that 
generated a surprising reaction on the interested 
audience, namely my fellow coleagues geometers, 
the TD artists community, and the Boom Festival 
community. that feedback gave meaning to the 
publication and release of this tool.

the aim for publication is to support the further 
development of this tool, either by other 
developers in the open-source spirit, or by anyone 
that use this tool and want to help supporting 
via the Patreon platform.

it is also a way of retribution to the fantastic 
TouchDesigner community, that along the years of 
using TD allways gave generously without asking for 
return.

INSTALL AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

this package contains the 4 processes of geoMusica:

geoMusicaEngine: 
its the heart of geoMusica, where the geometrical 
shapes get converted into MIDI signal, and also 
frequencies and triggers for geoMusicaSynth. the 
Engine tries to run at 480 fps, so it matches the MIDI
standard timming resolution. You should connect 
the Engine via MIDI to your favorite sound source, 
preferably a Polyphonic Aftertouch able synth so you 
can enjoy the full spectrum of frequencies that 
geoMusica generates.

geoMusicaUI: 
the control center for the system, here you define
all the parameters to generate the compositions, 
create presets with TDMorph (Darien Brito) and synchronize 
with external systems.

geoMusicaRender:
here the geometry gets visualized, in the most 
synthetical way possible, so you can focus on
the musical composition. You can run the Engine without
the Render if you want.

geoMusicaSynth:
just a simple wavetable synth made from the "howtoaudio.toe"
examples (Owen Kirby), to help people that do not know
how to handle MIDI to experiment with geoMusica. the Synth
is not essential for geoMusica, you can close it if you 
are using MIDI.



1. install Derivative TouchDesigner 2020.25680 
(https://derivative.ca/download/archive)

2. allow firewall access to TouchDesigner on both 
private and public networks (if asked)

3. run "geoMusica.2020.25380.bat"

4. wait for the 4 processes to open

5. on geoMusicaEngine, under "settings" page, select your 
MIDI Out Port. If you don't have a virtual midi loopback 
utility, I recommend loopMIDI by Tobias Erichsen 
(http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/) for localhost usage, 
and rtpMIDI for remote usage.

LICENSING:

Since we are artists/programmers and not lawyers, 
I trust you will give credit where credit is due 
and respect the licence: 

GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3) 

This means that if at some point you would like to 
use this tool in a commercial endeavour for which 
you do not want to disclose the source code you 
will get in touch first, so a fair arrangement 
can be made.

Enjoy!


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

ACKOWLEDGEMENTS:

geoMusica has benefit from the incredible work of 
Darien Brito with TDMorph, that allowed for a 
seamless integration of a preset system that is 
at the same timea parametric generative tool by 
itself, expanding the possibilities of geoMusica 
greatly.

geoMusicaSynth is based on the very much helpful
TD community asset from Owen Kirby, clarifying 
the correct way to do audio in TD, "howtoaudio.toe".
